## Getting Started for .NET

This repo contains sample applications written in C# that run on Google Cloud Platform.

See [https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/getting-started/hello-world](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/getting-started/hello-world) for instructions on how to build, run, and deploy the samples.

The [aspnet](aspnet) directory contains complete samples that you can build and run today.
The samples are built on ASP.NET 4.5.

The [core](core) directory is a work in progress.  It probably will not build or run correctly.
The samples are build on ASP.NET 5.

See our other [Google Cloud Platform github repos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform)
for sample applications and scaffolding for other frameworks and use cases.
